    <h3>A little <i>thing</i> about Me</h3>
    <p>Hey guys, I'm a aspiring software engineer that loves to eat alot. I grew up in Paynesville, Monrovia liberia 
        and my family later moved to Gardnesville where I currently live. I've been a curious person since I was a jit, and 
        I think that helps me to gather alot of information in the things that are essential to my growth. I love Networking with 
        new people because it opens your mind to alot of possiblities, that are out there you may not be aware of.

        <h3>Me at KIT</h3> 
        <p>
            My experience at the KIT has been wonderful, because I have learned a lot of things about the world wide web. Like the founder of the w.w.w 
            Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and it was also founded in the year 1989. I also love how the KIT is interactive and we have a wonderful
            instructor.
